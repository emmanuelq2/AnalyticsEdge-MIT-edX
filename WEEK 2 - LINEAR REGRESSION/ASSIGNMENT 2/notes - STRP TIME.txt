OK, found it by experimenting: dataset$column = as.factor(dataset$column) Was just too scared to try it at first :)

You can use the as.Date() or the strptime() functions, specifying the format of the date. 
You can then extract numbers such as month using month <- format(date,"%m"). Use the ?strptime command to see what all the notations mean, 
such as %m, %M, %Y, etc.

Unless i am missing something I have copy pasted the date function provided in 2.2 (see below) and it is giving N/A values. 
I cant seem to proceed any further and will lose points in this homework. 
This function was not covered in any of the videos as well DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
